Yes he won't look out for other big companies or billionaires, but there is nothing to suggest he won't look out for his own self interest, which is most likely similar to corporations/the rich. In fact his own former staff members suggest he is mostly interested in helping his own interests. I think this is a flawed logic from his supporters. Also if Trump truly wants to sell the public on the fact he has financed his campaign himself and wants to downplay his external donations, he wouldn't have two massive donation buttons on his website and have over $7 million in donations. He personally has not donated much himself, his company has loaned the campaign a lot which he can pay back to himself with interest from the donations of his supporters. This whole topic is widely misrepresented.

He is given the chance to say something positive or say they shouldn't be targeted by his supporters. Really he could say anything, but he never addresses it or says anything constructive, all he does is talk about radical islamic terrorists. He never amended his statement that most illegal immigrants were rapists or bringing drugs. He purposefully was wishy washy about the David Duke thing while the southern states were voting, and only waited until they were over to make a stronger statement. He straight up has denied black people from attending his events, even when they were supporters and not protestors in any way. He has thrown out multiple middle eastern and black people from his rallies who were not doing anything wrong or protesting. \n\nI will say middle eastern refugees and drugs coming up from mexico are problems, but there are so much better ways to address those issues without characterizing entire populations of people as certain ways. He has handled them so poorly, but its not because he is stupid, it is calculated. He is saying purposefully ignorant and hateful statements to pander to his supporters who are hateful people. Thats why he doesn't apologize or retract statements when given the chance, he is saying what his supporters want to hear. They want to label illegal mexican immigrants as criminals (instead of hard working manual laborers which they largely are) and middle eastern refugees as extremists (instead of peaceful people, which they largely are. Less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists). He may not be racist but he is purposefully using hate as a tool for popularity.
