Not really afraid, more like - it won't LAST, but it could be good to scare the normal politicians straight or at least tidy up a bit.

I'm not into that "Those who yell loudest - wins" thing, I'm for well tought through planning and careful attention to the needs of the population rather than a popularity contest. 

I've never understood why people trust those who have been into the movie business (Reagan, Arnold etc. etc.) just because they have a famous face. Your face doesn't save your population or make you more intelligent or give you more skills.

Trump has extensive business experience. That's where he excells, he can make mistakes too - just like the rest of us, but as a politician he would be terrible, no tact, too much profanity, too much See mee Seeee meeee.

taxing systems were made for public welfare by putting money back in to the economy so people can spend. think of money like oil. you need oil to drive your economy...now with all these rich dorks setting up tax havens they take money out of the economy so you and i don't have as much to spend. the thing that makes this instance new to history is they did it with dissociative guilt wherein setting up a charity (moral good) compensated for the general bad that they were doing.

What blows my mind is why anyone would support him. I mean watch his interviews and debates, when they ask him questions, he just starts talking about something else, he insults others, or brags about his poll numbers. When they ask him policy questions he is vague or just doesn't answer questions. When people actually call him out on the ridiculously awful things he has said, he doesn't apologize or take responsibility. He is delusional about how "he is the least racist person/ least sexist person/ most pro-isreal/ biggest on military" etc when there is literally nothing to support these claims, and usually evidence of the direct opposite. People are literally only supporting him because they are angry about Obama for the last 8 years (however unjustly). But why you would want this man to be the face of our country is mind blowing. He will ruin every single diplomatic relationship, he will set social issues 20-30 years back, he will cause deeper divides between racial/social groups. I honestly question the intelligence of any Trump supporter. The only good thing is like others have said, it might be a good shock to the system and open our eyes to what we need in politicians. He is a symbol for all the awful things that a lot of people in this country believe deep down, and that's scary.

I have read their responses, I don't find them valid. Saying he is going to look out for the people instead of corporations because he doesn't accept corporate money is a flawed logic. He IS one of the corporate people who would want beneficial polices, he is just cutting out the middle man by directly running. His own staff members have supported this claim saying he is only interested in his own interest, doesn't even want to be president and isn't equipped to be president. Also assuming his real estate business success will translate to macro economic success is such a reach as well. His success in business is greatly over stated anyway. He says he wants to bring jobs here and get Americans jobs yet he has continuously sent production overseas or hired illegal workers here, as another example of saying things people want to hear, while not following them. He has flipped or lied about most of his major beliefs to fit the narrative of the republican party, he is a fraud.  Also he has no political experience or record so he has the luxury of insulting every one else's actions with none of his own that can judged. It is easy to sit back and criticize others and failed policies, but he has absolutely no experience of his own to highlight. The few stances he had made in the past such as abortion and the war, he has just flipped and not been held responsible for his past views. Not a single thing to support about him. Just listen to him speak when interviewed and asked questions, he never answers the questions directly.

I don't see why this matters much. Yes he won't look out for other big companies or billionaires, but there is nothing to suggest he won't look out for his own self interest, which is most likely similar to corporations/the rich. In fact his own former staff members suggest he is mostly interested in helping his own interests. I think this is a flawed logic from his supporters. Also if Trump truly wants to sell the public on the fact he has financed his campaign himself and wants to downplay his external donations, he wouldn't have two massive donation buttons on his website and have over $7 million in donations. He personally has not donated much himself, his company has loaned the campaign a lot which he can pay back to himself with interest from the donations of his supporters. This whole topic is widely misrepresented.

Being composed and logical in the face of adversity is the mentality of a strong leader. Not being "PC" and not having a filter is not a good trait to have when dealing with other world leaders.

Here's the thing, people have given him the chance to address all the American Muslims, Sikhs, and other groups that are becoming victims of middle eastern hate brought on by his comments.  He is given the chance to say something positive or say they shouldn't be targeted by his supporters. Really he could say anything, but he never addresses it or says anything constructive, all he does is talk about radical islamic terrorists. He never amended his statement that most illegal immigrants were rapists or bringing drugs. He purposefully was wishy washy about the David Duke thing while the southern states were voting, and only waited until they were over to make a stronger statement. He straight up has denied black people from attending his events, even when they were supporters and not protestors in any way. He has thrown out multiple middle eastern and black people from his rallies who were not doing anything wrong or protesting. 

I will say middle eastern refugees and drugs coming up from mexico are problems, but there are so much better ways to address those issues without characterizing entire populations of people as certain ways. He has handled them so poorly, but its not because he is stupid, it is calculated. He is saying purposefully ignorant and hateful statements to pander to his supporters who are hateful people. Thats why he doesn't apologize or retract statements when given the chance, he is saying what his supporters want to hear. They want to label illegal mexican immigrants as criminals (instead of hard working manual laborers which they largely are) and middle eastern refugees as extremists (instead of peaceful people, which they largely are. Less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists). He may not be racist but he is purposefully using hate as a tool for popularity.

Assuming he could win, I'd be afraid for the people he is encouraging his supporters to hate. His campaign reminds me of bad reality TV - he says and does whatever her can to make things interesting for the people that are still paying attention. 

That is NOT how we should want to be viewed by the rest of the world. 

Also, I don't think he has a clear vision of what he can or will really do in office. His rallies are a big show, but his interviews seem to show he is focused on buzz words and misdirection. I'm curious what a psychiatrist would say after several sessions with him.

Because he's impulsive and acts without any regard to the consequences. We've already seen what happens when a man-child who knows how to win a popularity contest becomes President: pointless wars, out of control spending, and economic disaster. Trump thinks there are simple answers to every problem, and when he implements them, disaster will follow. He will utterly ruin our reputation in the world and irrevocably harm our standing with our allies. He's already proven he isn't trustworthy. The man can't even have a consistent position on abortion for more than a few hours. How's that going to play out when he goes to exercise his "tremendous" negotiating powers when no world leader he talks to will believe a word he says? What happens when he lies to Putin's face and gets called out? Talk about how his dick is bigger than Putins?

Electing Donald Trump would be like electing a six-year-old boy.

The worst thing about Trump, however, is that he does not support the Constitution. The man is a tyrant-in-waiting. He's a pure authoritarian. He waves off the first amendment like it's optional. He goads his thugs into beating people up. He tolerates no dissent and takes every attack against him personally. The man has thin skin, and complete lack of regard for all the principles this country was founded upon, and people want to give him the most powerful position in the country? Command of the armed forces? 

Donald Trump is the only POTUS I could see using the military to overthrow congress and the supreme court to install himself as dictator-for-life. He doesn't care what's legal or ethical. He is the definition of immoral. He is completely devoid of morals and values. He has no principles, no scruples. A man like him should *never* come *close* to the power he is within reach of.

Trump will be a great President, he doesn't take campaign money from the evil corporations who expect favors in return. He campaigns with his own money. Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, we need to stop having everything manufactured in China. Detroit could be what it used to be if the automobile manufacturers started working bin the USA again. He wants to keep illegal immigrants crossing the Mexico border out, that would help stop drug flow and terrorism. We're in the middle of a heroin epidemic almost all that heroin comes from Mexico. Trump wants to make America the country that it used to be, the best country in the world, which right now we are far from the best.

What blows my mind is why anyone would support him. I mean watch his interviews and debates, when they ask him questions, he just starts talking about something else, he insults others, or brags about his poll numbers. When they ask him policy questions he is vague or just doesn't answer questions. When people actually call him out on the ridiculously awful things he has said, he doesn't apologize or take responsibility. He is delusional about how "he is the least racist person/ least sexist person/ most pro-isreal/ biggest on military" etc when there is literally nothing to support these claims, and usually evidence of the direct opposite. People are literally only supporting him because they are angry about Obama for the last 8 years (however unjustly). But why you would want this man to be the face of our country is mind blowing. He will ruin every single diplomatic relationship, he will set social issues 20-30 years back, he will cause deeper divides between racial/social groups. I honestly question the intelligence of any Trump supporter. The only good thing is like others have said, it might be a good shock to the system and open our eyes to what we need in politicians. He is a symbol for all the awful things that a lot of people in this country believe deep down, and that's scary.

Not really afraid, more like - it won't LAST, but it could be good to scare the normal politicians straight or at least tidy up a bit.

I'm not into that "Those who yell loudest - wins" thing, I'm for well tought through planning and careful attention to the needs of the population rather than a popularity contest. 

I've never understood why people trust those who have been into the movie business (Reagan, Arnold etc. etc.) just because they have a famous face. Your face doesn't save your population or make you more intelligent or give you more skills.

Trump has extensive business experience. That's where he excells, he can make mistakes too - just like the rest of us, but as a politician he would be terrible, no tact, too much profanity, too much See mee Seeee meeee.

Detroit could be what it used to be if the automobile manufacturers started working bin the USA again. He wants to keep illegal immigrants crossing the Mexico border out, that would help stop drug flow and terrorism. We're in the middle of a heroin epidemic almost all that heroin comes from Mexico. Trump wants to make America the country that it used to be, the best country in the world, which right now we are far from the best.

What blows my mind is why anyone would support him. I mean watch his interviews and debates, when they ask him questions, he just starts talking about something else, he insults others, or brags about his poll numbers. When they ask him policy questions he is vague or just doesn't answer questions. When people actually call him out on the ridiculously awful things he has said, he doesn't apologize or take responsibility. He is delusional about how "he is the least racist person/ least sexist person/ most pro-isreal/ biggest on military" etc when there is literally nothing to support these claims, and usually evidence of the direct opposite. People are literally only supporting him because they are angry about Obama for the last 8 years (however unjustly). But why you would want this man to be the face of our country is mind blowing. He will ruin every single diplomatic relationship, he will set social issues 20-30 years back, he will cause deeper divides between racial/social groups. I honestly question the intelligence of any Trump supporter. The only good thing is like others have said, it might be a good shock to the system and open our eyes to what we need in politicians. He is a symbol for all the awful things that a lot of people in this country believe deep down, and that's scary.

I have read their responses, I don't find them valid. Saying he is going to look out for the people instead of corporations because he doesn't accept corporate money is a flawed logic. He IS one of the corporate people who would want beneficial polices, he is just cutting out the middle man by directly running. His own staff members have supported this claim saying he is only interested in his own interest, doesn't even want to be president and isn't equipped to be president. Also assuming his real estate business success will translate to macro economic success is such a reach as well. His success in business is greatly over stated anyway. He says he wants to bring jobs here and get Americans jobs yet he has continuously sent production overseas or hired illegal workers here, as another example of saying things people want to hear, while not following them. He has flipped or lied about most of his major beliefs to fit the narrative of the republican party, he is a fraud.  Also he has no political experience or record so he has the luxury of insulting every one else's actions with none of his own that can judged. It is easy to sit back and criticize others and failed policies, but he has absolutely no experience of his own to highlight. The few stances he had made in the past such as abortion and the war, he has just flipped and not been held responsible for his past views. Not a single thing to support about him. Just listen to him speak when interviewed and asked questions, he never answers the questions directly.

I don't see why this matters much. Yes he won't look out for other big companies or billionaires, but there is nothing to suggest he won't look out for his own self interest, which is most likely similar to corporations/the rich. In fact his own former staff members suggest he is mostly interested in helping his own interests. I think this is a flawed logic from his supporters. Also if Trump truly wants to sell the public on the fact he has financed his campaign himself and wants to downplay his external donations, he wouldn't have two massive donation buttons on his website and have over $7 million in donations. He personally has not donated much himself, his company has loaned the campaign a lot which he can pay back to himself with interest from the donations of his supporters. This whole topic is widely misrepresented.

I have never heard of a public figure who is as sensitive to criticism as Trump.  Insulting others and attempting to bully people is not a strong leader. Being composed and logical in the face of adversity is the mentality of a strong leader. Not being "PC" and not having a filter is not a good trait to have when dealing with other world leaders. Also he has proven to have very little knowledge of foreign policy.

Here's the thing, people have given him the chance to address all the American Muslims, Sikhs, and other groups that are becoming victims of middle eastern hate brought on by his comments.  He is given the chance to say something positive or say they shouldn't be targeted by his supporters. Really he could say anything, but he never addresses it or says anything constructive, all he does is talk about radical islamic terrorists. He never amended his statement that most illegal immigrants were rapists or bringing drugs. He purposefully was wishy washy about the David Duke thing while the southern states were voting, and only waited until they were over to make a stronger statement. He straight up has denied black people from attending his events, even when they were supporters and not protestors in any way. He has thrown out multiple middle eastern and black people from his rallies who were not doing anything wrong or protesting. 

I will say middle eastern refugees and drugs coming up from mexico are problems, but there are so much better ways to address those issues without characterizing entire populations of people as certain ways. He has handled them so poorly, but its not because he is stupid, it is calculated. He is saying purposefully ignorant and hateful statements to pander to his supporters who are hateful people. Thats why he doesn't apologize or retract statements when given the chance, he is saying what his supporters want to hear. They want to label illegal mexican immigrants as criminals (instead of hard working manual laborers which they largely are) and middle eastern refugees as extremists (instead of peaceful people, which they largely are. Less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists). He may not be racist but he is purposefully using hate as a tool for popularity.

Not really afraid, more like - it won't LAST, but it could be good to scare the normal politicians straight or at least tidy up a bit.

I'm not into that "Those who yell loudest - wins" thing, I'm for well tought through planning and careful attention to the needs of the population rather than a popularity contest. 

I've never understood why people trust those who have been into the movie business (Reagan, Arnold etc. etc.) just because they have a famous face. Your face doesn't save your population or make you more intelligent or give you more skills.

Trump has extensive business experience. That's where he excells, he can make mistakes too - just like the rest of us, but as a politician he would be terrible, no tact, too much profanity, too much See mee Seeee meeee.

That is NOT how we should want to be viewed by the rest of the world. 

Also, I don't think he has a clear vision of what he can or will really do in office. His rallies are a big show, but his interviews seem to show he is focused on buzz words and misdirection. I'm curious what a psychiatrist would say after several sessions with him.

Because he's impulsive and acts without any regard to the consequences. We've already seen what happens when a man-child who knows how to win a popularity contest becomes President: pointless wars, out of control spending, and economic disaster. Trump thinks there are simple answers to every problem, and when he implements them, disaster will follow. He will utterly ruin our reputation in the world and irrevocably harm our standing with our allies. He's already proven he isn't trustworthy. The man can't even have a consistent position on abortion for more than a few hours. How's that going to play out when he goes to exercise his "tremendous" negotiating powers when no world leader he talks to will believe a word he says? What happens when he lies to Putin's face and gets called out? Talk about how his dick is bigger than Putins?

Electing Donald Trump would be like electing a six-year-old boy.

The worst thing about Trump, however, is that he does not support the Constitution. The man is a tyrant-in-waiting. He's a pure authoritarian. He waves off the first amendment like it's optional. He goads his thugs into beating people up. He tolerates no dissent and takes every attack against him personally. The man has thin skin, and complete lack of regard for all the principles this country was founded upon, and people want to give him the most powerful position in the country? Command of the armed forces? 

Donald Trump is the only POTUS I could see using the military to overthrow congress and the supreme court to install himself as dictator-for-life. He doesn't care what's legal or ethical. He is the definition of immoral. He is completely devoid of morals and values. He has no principles, no scruples. A man like him should *never* come *close* to the power he is within reach of.

The fact that Trump is the comment section of the internet summed up into one person.

Trump will be a great President, he doesn't take campaign money from the evil corporations who expect favors in return. He campaigns with his own money. Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, we need to stop having everything manufactured in China. Detroit could be what it used to be if the automobile manufacturers started working bin the USA again. He wants to keep illegal immigrants crossing the Mexico border out, that would help stop drug flow and terrorism. We're in the middle of a heroin epidemic almost all that heroin comes from Mexico. Trump wants to make America the country that it used to be, the best country in the world, which right now we are far from the best.

What blows my mind is why anyone would support him. I mean watch his interviews and debates, when they ask him questions, he just starts talking about something else, he insults others, or brags about his poll numbers. When they ask him policy questions he is vague or just doesn't answer questions. When people actually call him out on the ridiculously awful things he has said, he doesn't apologize or take responsibility. He is delusional about how "he is the least racist person/ least sexist person/ most pro-isreal/ biggest on military" etc when there is literally nothing to support these claims, and usually evidence of the direct opposite. People are literally only supporting him because they are angry about Obama for the last 8 years (however unjustly). But why you would want this man to be the face of our country is mind blowing. He will ruin every single diplomatic relationship, he will set social issues 20-30 years back, he will cause deeper divides between racial/social groups. I honestly question the intelligence of any Trump supporter. The only good thing is like others have said, it might be a good shock to the system and open our eyes to what we need in politicians. He is a symbol for all the awful things that a lot of people in this country believe deep down, and that's scary.

He would be a great president, the best in generations. He's already showing what he can do even when everyone is aligned against him. Showed tremendous resolve under pressure, imagine what he could do as president.

MAGA

As a Brit I'm not too scared, sure there may well be a cooling of relations given that Trump is an idiot that has pissed a lot of Scotland off. I anticipate that he may well be a fairly impotent president (insert penis size joke here) since he's ruffled republican and democrats alike so far. I don't see him passing too many laws if he doesn't at least get the republicans back on side.
